My own social network inspired by facebook

Not complete, i am puting it here so i dont loose everything in case of hardware failiure on my side.

Functionality:
- You can register, login and find your friends! (if they are registered as well that is)
- You can befriend them, and see what they post.
- Ability to create chat with your friends where you can talk to each other
- Posting comments under the posts
- Changing your profile, BIO
- Liking or disliking posts


In future:
- SCD2 implementation for edits on posts,  maybe users as well
- Not just deleting messages without a trace, but setting them in database to deleted and show "Message has been deleted"
- Security
- Testing
- Design
- Sending photos through the chat
- Private profile option
- messages, read not read
